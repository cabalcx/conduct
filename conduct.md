# What is cabal?

Cabal’s overarching mission is to fight dystopia. The group was founded on the principles of 

- ​	free software
- ​	safe spaces
- ​	shared information, and ultimately:
- ​	shifting technology forward to better protect the underprivileged and underserved.

The discord server is the latest iteration of cabal. It is the homebase for our community of hackers, programmers, lawyers, librarians, anthropologists, journalists, soldiers, spooks, et. al. who all believe that we can combat the misuse and abuse of technology with actions overt and covert.

# When to use the #general channel

most of the chat happens in #general-and-banter. It’s okay to mute it! Critical updates will be posted in the #announcements channel.

# How to mute a channel!

So Discord’s default subscription is ~Notifications On~ for every channel (unless your device’s notifications have blocked all Discord notifications completely). Since cabal’s channels are broken out by topic, go ahead and mute things you aren’t as interested in! The channels will always be there should you wanna check it out later.

# Rules of the Road

- ​	There will be absolutely no fucking bigotry tolerated in this space.
- ​	Treat other members with respect.  
- ​	Engage in good faith.



- ​	Act with consent.
- ​	Seek permission, not forgiveness.
- ​	Try to resolve conflict in a mature and mutually acceptable manner.
- ​	If you ever feel that there has been a violation, please involve an Admin and we will work it out!



- ​	What is said in this chat stays in this chat. It does not matter if disclosure was intentional or unintentional.
- ​	Please, no forwarding or screenshots.
- ​	If the party/parties involved have all given consent, then exfiltration may be settled on a case-by-case basis.



- ​	Admins take on the role of moderators for the group.
- ​	Admin tasks may include tasks like organizing content, structuring a conversation, and inviting new members.
- ​	Admins are appointed via a plurality vote by all members. There should always be at least 3 at one time.



- ​	Most decisions can be brought to a vote with a quorum of at least half the chat membership.
- ​	Decisions may pass with a simple plurality; Bans and suspensions of members require a majority.

# How to hangout on discord

Use the sidebar on the left to find a topic you're interested in. Join the voice channels to hangout with other members! It's a great way to collab and riff off each other. Try to stay on topic, and if the channel topic doesn't make sense, resort to #general-and-banter 

# Use the bots!

Additional help can be found from our friendly bots @cabalbot and @gastonbot , as well of the admins of the month. try talking to @cabalbot in a DM, or in a channel! DM the bot help or use @cabalbot help in a channel.

# Inviting new friends

Notify in #general-and-banter that you'd like to invite someone, which starts a request for comments period. This period is typically enough time for people to see your post and send whatever comments they need (12-24 hours). Sometimes it helps by providing context about the person (i know them from ...  or here is their twitter ...). If no objections are raised, you are clear to invite them in!



# Brief history of Cabal

it is legally foolish and intellectually questionable to dub cabal a "hacker group" but whatever.

cabal started as a signal group chat of friends who hacked stuff and wanted a better future for each other.



The group started because there were too many asshats showing up to hacker meetups like NYSEC. our group transitioned to be a bit more operative, on issues we cared about, namely r*v*nge porn, stalking, and "cyber sexual abuse". obviously it has expanded in scope, and in membership; at its peak we have had 55 members join our ranks.



today the point is to be a community for each other, but also to be a resource to the community. our cohorts at the NY Cyber Sexual Abuse taskforce are technically informed lawyers, but are always so, so appreciative of the perspective we bring there on how cybercrimez and crimnalz are done.



the biggest initiatives we have now are:

- ​	supporting cyber sexual abuse survivors
- ​	tracking hate groups, their infrastructure, and their behavior online
- ​	compiling a record of notable incidents and artifacts that document technology's abuses
- ​	clowning on false thought leaders and decimating gatekeepers



Some of our wins in the past year or so:



- ​	Combatting cyber sexual abuse
  - ​		Dozens of successful takedown 	requests
  - ​		Assistance to sex workers on the 	protection of their copyrighted material
  - ​		Security incident response to 4 	severe cases of abuse
  - ​		Technical subject matter expertise 	supporting the NYC Cyber Sexual Abuse Taskforce
  - ​		Research and monitoring into 	distribution sites and forums
- ​	Racial, economic, and social justice activism
  - ​		Our group development of 	submit.policetapes.live, which has archived thousands of videos 	documenting police brutality around the USA
  - ​		Creation of our VPN services, which 	have protected dozens of activists and journalists through the 	summer
  - ​		Distribution of thousands of PPE kits 	during NYC protests
  - ​		 Secure communications assistance for 	5 major protest organizers in NYC
  - ​		Secure communications for protestors 	in Cuba
- ​	Press coverage of our doingz:
  - ​		Clearview AI (NYTimes, Gizmodo)
  - ​		Phunware (Vice News)
  - ​		Tinder photo market place (Gizmodo)
- ​	Conferences and Speaking Engagements
  - ​		PancakesCon 2021
  - ​		Summercon 2020
  - ​		Diana Initiative
